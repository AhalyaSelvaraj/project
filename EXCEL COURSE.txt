      COMMAND->CERTAIN ACTIONS PERFORMED 

  * SHEET WERE WE PERFORM THE OPERATIONS OR WHERE WE WORK
      DIVIDED INTO 2-> ROWS AND COLUMN
      ROWS IS THE HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT AND ROWS ARE THE VERTICAL ALIGNMENT
      ROWS (LEFT TO RIGHT) COLUMN (UP TO DOWN)

COLLETION OF CELLS IN WHICH THE VALUES CAN BE TYPED
WORKBOOK CONTAINS MULTIPLE WOORK SHEETS
+ BUTTON CAN ADD MULIPLE SHEETS
RENAME THE SHEET NAME BY RIGHT CLICKING ON IT


EXCEL RANGES

NAME BOX -> GIVES THE NAME OF THE CELL SELECTED(TOP LEFT)

WORK WITH SELECTIONS OF CELLS
  * SELECT A CELL
        USING MOUSE AND NAVIGATING
       
  * SELECT MULTIPLE CELLS
        BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE CONTROL CELLS WE CAN SELECT MULTIPLE CELLS

  * SELECT A COLUMN
        CLICK THE NAME A IN THE COLUMN BAR SO THAT THE CELLS IN THE COLUMN A IS SELECTED
        
  * SELECT A ROW
        CLICK THE ROW 3  IN THE ROW BAR SO THAT THE CELLS IN THE ROW 3 IS SELECTED

  *SELECTING THE ENTIRE SHEET
        CLICKTHE TRIANGLE AT THE TOP LEFT CORNER SO THAT THE ENTIRE SHEET WILL BE SELECTED ELSE CLICK CTRL + A

  * SELECTING RANGES IN EXCEL
         NAMEBOX
         DRAG TO MARK A RANGE


FILLING IN EXCEL
CLICK ON THE CELLS ,YOU WILL SEE A SQUARE AT THE END,CLICK ON IT AND O WILL GET A PLUS BUTTON AND LEFT CLICK AND DRAG AND DROP.

=SUM(B2:D2)->GIVES THE ADDITION OF THE CELLS FOR B2 TO D2

SUBRACTION OPERATOR
- SYMBOL

MULTIPLICATON OPERATOR
* SYMBOL
=B5*5 ALSO CAN BE DONE

DIVISION OPERATOR 
/ SYMBOL IS USED
=B5/3 ALSO CON BE DONE


PARANTHESIS IN EXCEL

CHANGE THE ORDER OF AN OPERATION
=(B1*C2)+56
WITH,WITHOUT,WITH MANY PARENTHESIS


UNDO

RECOVER DELECTED COLUMN AND ROW
REVERSE WRONG SORTING OR FILTERING

TWO WISAYS:
UNDO BUTTON IN UNDO FUNCTION

REDO 
CTRL+Y


FORMATTING -> TEXT,PICTURES ARE ORGANIZED 
DOCUMENT FORMATTING ->FONT SELECTION ,FONT SIZE,SPACING,MARGINS, ALIGNMENT,COLUMNS,INDENDATION,LISTS

EXCEL FUNCTIONS
INBUILT FORMULAS -> FUNCTIONS
INITIATED WITH = AND THEN FOLLOWED BY NAME (=SUM)
SUM (ADDS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE VALUES(=SUM))

SUMIF

=SUMIF(D2:D11,"F",(E2:E11)) D2:D11 GENDER AND IF TE GENDER IS F THEN ADD THE SALARY FROM THE GIVEN RANGE E2 TO E11 THAT SALARY FIELD

SUMIFS SAMEAS SUMIF BUT YOU CAN ADD MULTPLE FIELDS  (=SUMIFS(E2:E11,D2:D11,"M",C2:C11,"76")) E2:E11 IS THE SALARY FIELD D2:D11 IS GENDER AND IN GENDER IS MALE AND THE AGE IS 76 THEN SHOW THE SUM OF THE SALARY
SUMIFS USED FOR MULTIPLE CRITERIA

AVREAGE

=AVERAGE
ADDS AND DIVUDE BY NUMBER OF OBSERVATION

AVERAGE IF AND AVERAGE IFS SAME AS SUMIF AND SUM IFS

COUNT
COUNT THE CELLS WITH THE NUM,BERS IN RANGE
=COUNT
NUMBER OF PERSONS OR VALUES PRESENT IN THE CELLS
ONLY WORKS WITH THE CELLS WITH NUMBERS NOT LETTERS

COUNTA 
IT COUNT THE CELLS WITH LETTERS AND NUMERALS

COUNTBLANK
COUNTS THE NUMBER OF BLANK CELLS IN A ROW 

COUNTIF 
IF WE ENTER THE RANGE AS GENDER AND THE CRITERIA AS FEMALE THEN THE COUNT OF FEMALE WILL BE GIVEN

COUNTIFS

=COUNTIFS(D2:D11,"F",C2:C11,"23") SO WE HAVE GIVEN THE GENDER ROW AS FEMALE AND THE AGE AS 23 . SO IF THE GENDER IS F AND THE AGE IS 23 THE COUNT OF THIS WILL BE GIVEN

MIN
GIVES THE N=MINIMUN FUNCTION IN A RANGE
=MIN

MAX 
GIVES THE MAXIMUM VALUE IN A RANGE

MEDIAN 
RETURNS THE MIDDLE VALUE IN THE DATA
=MEDIAN
NEED NOT SORT THE DATA

MODE 
IT IS USED TO FIND THE DATA WHICH APPEARS THE MOST

LEFT
IT RETRIEVES THE NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM THE LEFT EG:AHALYA =LEFT(G1:G2,"3")  AHA

RIGHT
IT RETRIEVES THE NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM THE RIGHT EG:AHALYA =RIGHT(G1:G2,"3")  LYA

LOWER
LOWERCASE THE LETTERS
=LOWER

UPPERCASE
UPPERCASE THE LETTERS
=UPPER

TRIM
REMOVE IRRUGULAR SPACING
 ETC..
